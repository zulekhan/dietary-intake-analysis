    "# **Gender Differences in Dietary Intake: A Statistical Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "This project analyzes gender-based differences in dietary intake using data from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)**. The goal is to determine whether males and females have significantly different consumption patterns for **calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fats**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Research Questions**\n",
    "1. Do males and females consume different amounts of **total calories**?\n",
    "2. Are there significant differences in **protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake** between genders?\n",
    "3. What insights can be drawn from dietary trends, and how might they inform public health recommendations?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methodology**\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: We used two datasets from NHANES, available on Kaggle.\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning & Merging**: We filtered and combined the datasets based on participant ID (`SEQN`).\n",
    "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We computed summary statistics and visualized data using bar plots and boxplots.\n",
    "4. **Statistical Testing**: We conducted an **independent t-test** to compare dietary intake between males and females.\n",
    "5. **Interpretation & Discussion**: We evaluated findings and suggested potential implications.\n",
